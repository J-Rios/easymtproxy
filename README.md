# Easy-MTProxy

Easy tool to simplify installation and setup of MTProxy for Telegram.

Install and use MTProxy in a single step by running a single command.

This is a BASH script that automatically gets, compile and setup MTProxy on a Debian based Linux system. It creates a systemd Service for MTProxy so you don't need to bother to make MTProxy run or recover from errors or systems restarts.

You can use it in a personal computer, a server or a Single Board Computar like a Raspberry Pi.
